Functional requirement:
1.) uploading
2.) dowloading
3.)Sync between different devices
4.)Notifications

Non Functional requirement:
1.)High availability
2.)High consistency
3.)Scaling purpose will be handled after getting an overview of no. of devices in the cluster

Clients:
mobile,desktop

Devices in cluster
1.) 100 million devices(1 million active daily)
2.) 1 file per day per device
3.)avg file size 5mb, max 15 gigs

Math=1 million* 15 gigabyte=15 petabyte
QPS=1 million/24*3600=11
peak QPS=15
traffic=1million*5mb=5tb



Components:

At first I will design a setup for our client side server itself.
So my clients desktop app,website will be having following 4 important Components:
1.)Filewatcher:- This will keep an eye on whether there is some file uploaded currently or not
2.) Chunker:-This will divide the files into multiple chunks
3.)Indexer:-This will craete indexing or say will prepare the metadata
4.) Internal DB:- this will store the data related to the file loading
